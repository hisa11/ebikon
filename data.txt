Checksum
The AMT21 encoder uses a checksum calculation for detecting transmission errors. The upper two bits of every response from the
encoder are check bits. Those values are shown in the examples below as K1 and K0. The check bits are odd parity; K1 for the odd bits
in the response, and K0 for the even bits in the response. These check bits are not part of the position, but are used to verify its validity.
The remaining lower 14 bits are the useful data. Here is an example of how to calculate the checkbits for a 16-bit response, from a 14-bit
encoder.
Full response: 0x61AB
14-bit position: 0x21AB (8619 decimal)
Checkbit Formula
Odd: K1 = !(H5^H3^H1^L7^L5^L3^L1)
Even: K0 = !(H4^H2^H0^L6^L4^L2^L0)
From the above response 0x61AB:
Odd: 0 = !(1^0^0^1^1^1^1) = correct
Even: 1 = !(0^0^1^0^0^0^1) = correct

RS485 INTERFACE (CONTINUED)
Addressing
The AMT21 encoder supports multiple encoders on the RS485 bus. This is accomplished by giving each encoder a unique node address.
This node address is 8 bits long but the low two bits must be 0. Therefore, the encoder can have any single byte value that is divisible by 4
which allows up to 64 encoders to share the bus.
By default, the node address is 0x54. Node addresses configurable via AMT ViewpointTM or set at factory for specific configuration upon
request.

*Default address
The node address serves also as the read position command which is why it will be referred to it as the base command. When the encoder
sees a command on the RS485 it reads the first 6 bits to determine if it should be listening. If it sees its address, then it interprets the low
two bits for the command.
Low two bitsHex000x00Read position
Command
010x01Read turns counter (multi-turn encoders only)
100x02Indicates extended command
110x03Reserved
For simplicity the user can abstract away the various bits and simply implement multiple commands in their system. For example:
Byte
Command
0x54Read position
0x55Read turns counter (multi-turn encoders only)
0x56Begin extended command
Extended Commands
There are some commands that require two bytes to be received before the encoder will enact them. This includes resets and zero saves.
This prevents collisions and allows the encoder to be fully functional while sharing the bus with other encoders.
Note that there are no responses to these instructions, and once received the encoder initiates an immediate reset. The user’s system
should expect to wait until the encoder is powered back up to send any follow up commands. Power on time is listed in the electrical
section above.
To send an extended command the user will send the <node address + 0x02> value (0x56 by default) followed by the <extended command>.

RS485 INTERFACE EXAMPLES
Single character commands
Read Position: <node_address>
The read position command is the same as the node address which has a default value of 0x54 is sent and the response is received with
the low byte first. After removing the checksum the result is 0x39E4. For a 14-bit encoder nothing else is required, the position is 14820
in decimal. However if this is a 12-bit encoder, the position must be shifted to the right 2 bits to throw away the low bits of the response.
Therefore the position would be 3705 in decimal.
Read Turns (multi-turn encoders only): <node_address + 0x01>
The turns counter command is <node_address + 0x01>. By default the turns counter command is 0x55. The encoder responds with the low
byte first and includes check bits same as the read position command. The resulting number is a signed 14 bit number. The response above
is showing 1 turn. This value is not retained between power cycles. After a power cycle, the value is reset to zero.
Extended commands
Set Zero Position (single turn encoders only): <node_address + 0x02> <0x5E>
The zero set command is <node_address + 0x02> followed by <0x5E>. By default we send 0x56 and then 0x5E. The encoder zero’s the
position and immediately resets.
Encoder Reset: <node_address + 0x02> <0x75>
The reset command is <node_address + 0x02> followed by <0x75>. By default the command to reset the encoder is 0x56 0x75. The
encoder performs and immediate reset.

ASSEMBLY PROCEDURE
STEP 1
STEP 2
STEP 3
Align Tool C with
flange on Base
1. Insert Tool A as a spacer that defines the distance to
the mounting surface.
2. Slide appropriate sized Sleeve over shaft all the way down to Tool A.
3. Slide Shaft Adaptor over Sleeve.
4. Use Tool C to press Shaft Adaptor over Sleeve (ensure Shaft Adapter
and Tool C spline alignment) until flush with Tool A.
STEP 4
1. Remove Tools A and C.
2. Place Base on motor, with Tool C used as a centering tool.
STEP 5
1. Snap the Top Cover onto the Base, carefully observing that the
teeth of the Shaft Adaptor align with the grooves in the hub. *
1. Fasten the Base on the motor (Tool C may need to be
rotated to allow for some mounting configurations).
2. Remove Tool C.
* We recommend no more than three cycles of mounting and
removal of the AMT top cover base. Multiple cycles of mounting
and removing the top cover can cause base fatigue over time and
affect encoder performance.
cuidevices.com
1. Align Tool C with flange on Base.
2. Slide Base and Tool C onto motor, centering onto
the Shaft Adapter.
STEP 6
1. Make sure the snaps are fully engaged by pressing
on the Hub with the reverse side of Tool C.
2. When assembly is finished, the Shaft Adaptor, Sleeve
and Rotor Hub should all be flush with the Motor
Shaft rotating freely.Additional Resources:
